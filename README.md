# Deep-Learning-with-Tensorflow

This repository contains my assignments and projects for the "Deep Learning with TensorFlow" course on Coursera.

## Course Description

This specialization contains 4 courses. 1. Introduction to TensorFlow in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
2. Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow
3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
4. Sequences, Time Series and Prediction 
These courses provide an introduction to Deep Learning using TensorFlow. It covers various topics such as neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), natural language processing (NLP), and more. Each week includes video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments to reinforce the concepts learned.
